# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 

As a data analyst for *PyBer*, a Python based ridesharing app, I have been tasked with creating a summary DataFrame of the ridesharing data by city type, and creating a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. The results of this analysis will provide PyBer's CEO with specific recommendations to improve residents' access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.  

## Results

The following summary data frame provides a concise overview of the ridesharing data by city type. 
![summary_df](https://github.com/MichaelaAnastasiaAustin/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/PyBer_Summary_df.png)

-  Rural cities bring in the least revenue, with the lowest number of rides, lowest number of drivers, and lowest total fares.
-  Urban cities generate the most revenue, with the highest number of rides, drivers, and total fares.
-  Suburban cities fall in the middle for all categories: total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per rider, and average fare per 
   driver. 


The Total Fare by City Type plot demonstrates ridesharing revenue from January 2019 through April 2019.

- Urban city ridesharing generated the most revenue
- Rural city ridesharing generated the least revenue
- Suburban city ridesharing revenue was in the middle
- All three city types experienced similar trends in late February when they hit a peak in total fares, and then dropped in total fares significantly   at the beginning of March.  

## Summary
	
Based on the results, there are three leading business recommendations for the CEO:
1) Leveraging Average Fare Per Driver in Rural Cities

Rural cities are bringing in the lowest total weekly fares, yet the average fare per driver is significantly higher than Urban and Suburban average fares per driver. I recommend leveraging this data point to attract more rideshare drivers. By increasing the number of available drivers in Rural areas, there will be more opportunities for residents to use rideshare, which will increase the overall fares brought in.

2) Maximizing Potential in Urban Cities

There are nearly double the number of total drivers than there are total rides  in Urban cities. This means ridesharing is likely being  underutilized, and has the potential to bring in even more revenue than it already is. To increase use of ridesharing in urban cities, I recommend launching a campaign to share the many benefits of ridesharing. The campaign should target the needs and interests of urban residents. 

3) Supporting Urban City Drivers

Urban cities are bringing in the highest total fares. As mentioned in the previous recommendation, this revenue is fueled by the large number of drivers. Though these drivers work in the highest total fare region, their average fare is the lowest. To increase driver satisfaction and morale, the company should work to address this. When staff of a company are supported, the reputation of a company will improve, which will lead to opportunities for growth and strategic corporate partnership.
